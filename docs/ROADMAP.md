# Roadmap

Companion to [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md). Gap IDs (A-1, C-2, …) refer to that document.
Sizing assumes one full-time developer; run phases in order — each one is a
prerequisite for the next.

---

## Phase 0 — Stop the bleeding (1 week)

Cheap, high-leverage, no architecture change.

- [ ] `git init`, first commit, branch protection. Nothing below is safe without it. *(B-7)*
- [ ] Add `.env`, `*.db`, `dist/`, `server/dist/`, `logs/`, `tmp/`,
      `_backup_before_onedrive_restore/` to `.gitignore`; **rotate `JWT_SECRET`**. *(B-3)*
- [ ] Delete the hardcoded owner email in `src/App.jsx:9068`. *(C-1)*
- [ ] Add `requirePermission('SALES', …, 'Invoices')` to all five invoice routes. *(C-2)*
- [ ] Scope login lookup by account, or make email globally unique. *(C-3)*
- [ ] Fix the server build (tsconfig → NodeNext + `.js` specifiers) so
      `npm run build && npm start` boots. *(B-1)*
- [ ] `docker compose up` green end to end; replace the PowerShell VS Code tasks
      with cross-platform npm scripts. *(B-2, B-5)*
- [ ] Delete the dead Sequelize backend. *(D-4)*

**Exit:** repo versioned, no known privilege bypass, one command starts the stack.

---

## Phase 1 — Make the server the system of record (4–6 weeks)

The core rewrite. Everything else depends on it.

- [ ] Postgres + a real `prisma/migrations` history; `Decimal(18,4)` on every
      money column. *(D-1, A-7)*
- [ ] Model the domain server-side: `Customer`, `Vendor`, `Item`, `Account`
      (chart of accounts), `Voucher` + `VoucherLine`, `Payment`, `Expense`,
      `Estimate`, `Bill`, `CreditNote`, `DebitNote`, `PurchaseOrder`. *(D-2)*
- [ ] **General ledger**: immutable `JournalEntry` + `JournalLine`. Every voucher
      posts inside one transaction; unbalanced entries are rejected; control
      accounts referenced by ID. Reversal by contra entry, never by mutation. *(A-3)*
- [ ] Server-side voucher numbering with a per-(org, branch, series) sequence. *(A-8)*
- [ ] CRUD + list APIs with pagination, filtering, and consistent
      `accountId + orgId + branchId` scoping. *(D-6)*
- [ ] Frontend switches from `localStorage`-as-database to API + a query cache
      (TanStack Query). Keep localStorage strictly as an offline read cache. *(A-1, A-2)*
- [ ] One-time importer: read an existing browser `accountingDB:*` blob and push
      it to the server, so current prototype data survives the migration.
- [ ] Tenancy isolation test suite (org A must never see org B) + ledger math tests. *(B-4)*

**Exit:** clearing browser storage loses nothing; two devices show the same book;
trial balance is derived from posted journal lines and foots to zero.

---

## Phase 2 — Trustworthy books (3–4 weeks)

- [ ] Fiscal years + period close (`books locked through <date>`), with an
      explicit reopen permission. *(A-4)*
- [ ] Audit log on every financial mutation: who, when, before/after. *(A-5)*
- [ ] Year-end closing entries and opening-balance carry-forward.
- [ ] Reports rewritten against the GL: Trial Balance, P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash
      Flow, Ledger, Day Book, Aged Receivables/Payables.
- [ ] Reconciliation rules: invoice ⇄ payment allocation, credit-note application,
      partial payments, write-offs.
- [ ] Negative-stock guard on transfers; apply `InventoryAdjustment` to
      `StockBalance`; one item catalog shared by UI and server. *(D-3, D-5)*

**Exit:** an accountant can close a month and the numbers don't move afterwards.

---

## Phase 3 — Product hardening (3–4 weeks)

- [ ] Split `App.jsx` (10.5k lines) into route-level modules; adopt
      `react-router`; lazy-load reports. *(E-1, E-2)*
- [ ] Permission set delivered by `/auth/me`; a `<Can>` gate so UI and API share
      one vocabulary. *(E-3, C-4 — move bootstrap out of the permission check)*
- [ ] Replace `alert()`/`confirm()` with toasts + dialogs; global 401/403 handling. *(E-4)*
- [ ] Auth hardening: rate limiting, account lockout, `crypto.randomBytes` reset
      tokens in the DB, refresh-token rotation, real logout, email verification. *(C-5, C-6, C-7)*
- [ ] Validate `orgIds`/`branchIds` on user creation against the caller's account. *(C-8)*
- [ ] Replace `$queryRawUnsafe` in `invoices.ts` with the typed Prisma client. *(C-9)*
- [ ] Structured logging (pino) + request IDs, Sentry, `/metrics`, nightly
      backups with a documented restore drill.
- [ ] CI: lint + typecheck + tests + docker build on every PR.

**Exit:** an on-call engineer can diagnose a production issue from logs alone.

---

## Phase 4 — Indian compliance depth (4–6 weeks)

- [ ] GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B export in the government JSON schema (today they are
      on-screen reports only).
- [ ] e-Invoice: IRN generation + signed QR via an IRP; QR on the printed invoice.
- [ ] e-Way bill generation and cancellation.
- [ ] GSTR-2B download and purchase reconciliation (matched / mismatched / missing).
- [ ] TDS and TCS: sections, rates, thresholds, challan tracking, Form 26Q data.
- [ ] Reverse charge, export/SEZ invoices with LUT, composition scheme handling.
- [ ] HSN summary and document summary as required by GSTR-1 tables.

**Exit:** a filing can be produced from the app without a spreadsheet in between.

---

## Phase 5 — Scale and reach (ongoing)

- [ ] Bank statement import (CSV/OFX/MT940) + reconciliation UI — the
      `bankTransactions` array already exists and nothing populates it.
- [ ] Recurring invoices, dunning/payment reminders, customer portal, payment links.
- [ ] Multi-currency with FX revaluation; cost centres, budgets, project accounting.
- [ ] Background job queue for PDF/export/email; object storage for attachments.
- [ ] Virtualized data grids, saved views, bulk actions, global search. *(E-6)*
- [ ] Mobile-responsive pass and accessibility audit. *(E-5)*
- [ ] Read-only auditor role; org-to-org data export (Tally/Zoho/QuickBooks shapes).

---

## Sequencing notes

- **Do not** start Phase 4 before Phase 1. Compliance exports built on a
  derived-at-render-time ledger will have to be rewritten.
- Phase 3's `App.jsx` split is easiest *during* Phase 1, while call sites are
  already being touched to swap localStorage for API calls — consider merging them.
- Each phase should end with a tagged release and a restore-from-backup drill.
