# Neev One application audit — 10 September 2026

## Executive verdict

**Overall readiness: 61/100 — strong late-stage prototype / controlled-pilot candidate, not ready for general commercial production.**

The accounting and tenancy foundations are materially stronger than the August audit. The app now has a real double-entry ledger, broad server-backed document and master coverage, pull-hydration, RBAC, session rotation, audit views, bank reconciliation, GST exports, CI and a deployment workflow. The public landing page is polished and loaded without browser-console errors in the audited desktop session.

General sale should remain blocked by the cross-account company-discovery defect, browser-held financial state and browser-only recurring scheduler, the lack of migration history/Postgres readiness, a failing backend test bootstrap in this checkout path, vulnerable production dependencies, and incomplete operating/compliance controls.

## Scorecard

| Area | Score | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| Feature breadth | 78 | Broad accounting surface; several enterprise/commercial features are explicit previews or absent |
| Accounting/data integrity | 62 | Strong server ledger, but UI still serialises a full shadow book in localStorage |
| UI consistency | 72 | Defined design system and automated palette checks; monolith and partial primitive adoption remain |
| UX/accessibility | 65 | Good public experience and keyboard utilities; authenticated flows not fully browser-tested in this run |
| Security | 58 | Strong tenant middleware and session design, offset by localStorage tokens, permission-time mutation and dependency advisories |
| Code/maintainability | 48 | Builds and frontend tests pass; 14,645-line `App.jsx`, hook warnings and dual data models are high risk |
| Test/release engineering | 55 | CI exists, but the backend suite cannot bootstrap in this checkout and emits obsolete Vitest config warnings |
| Operations/business readiness | 47 | Deploy/backup scripts exist; SQLite/db-push, no restore drill/observability/SLA controls |
| India compliance readiness | 52 | HSN/B2CL exports have improved; DPDP and audit-retention operations are not launch-complete |

## Release blockers

### P0-1 — Invited users cannot discover companies owned by another account

Tenant middleware correctly authorises a user from the membership's owning account, and tests prove a known foreign `orgId` can be accessed. Login and `/auth/me`, however, list memberships with `accountId: auth.accountId`. A person invited into another account therefore receives only home-account companies and cannot select the invited company in the UI.

Evidence: `server/src/routes/auth.ts:198-202`, `server/src/routes/auth.ts:325-332`; the cross-account test calls the foreign org URL directly instead of asserting it appears in login or `/auth/me` (`server/src/__tests__/globalIdentity.test.ts:102-117`).

Business impact: the advertised accountant/auditor/multi-client workflow is not usable without knowing internal IDs.

### P0-2 — The browser is still a second accounting database

The root app loads, normalises and rewrites the entire company book under `accountingDB:<account>:<org>` on every `db` change. Server hydration is additive and intentionally never deletes local rows. That avoids accidental loss but creates divergent truth, conflict and stale-deletion risks across devices.

Evidence: `src/App.jsx:11236-11346`; additive merge contract in `src/hooks/useServerDocSync.js:18-30` and merge implementation at `395-450`.

Specific client-only/high-risk workflows still include local journal entries and recurring templates. Recurring schedules run only when a browser signs in or the user presses Run; drafts are created in local state and are not a reliable background billing system (`src/hooks/useRecurringInvoices.js:61-147`).

### P0-3 — Database evolution is not production safe yet

The Prisma datasource is SQLite and there is no `server/prisma/migrations/` history. Deployment uses `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` after a bespoke preflight rather than versioned, repeatable migrations. Postgres is documented as requiring code changes because raw SQL uses SQLite placeholders.

Business impact: scaling, rollback, staged deployments, auditability of schema changes and multi-instance operation are unsafe.

### P0-4 — The backend verification gate is red in this checkout

`npm run test` produced 266/266 passing frontend tests, then the backend suite failed before collecting tests. `globalSetup.ts` constructs an absolute SQLite URL containing the workspace space (`WEB new`); Prisma reports `Schema engine error`. Running the schema push directly reproduced it. The same file also overrides the safer relative URL configured in `vitest.config.ts`.

Evidence: `server/src/__tests__/globalSetup.ts:13-26`, `server/vitest.config.ts:14-20`.

CI may pass in `/home/runner/work/...` without spaces, which makes this a local portability failure and a coverage blind spot rather than proof that server tests are inherently broken.

## High-priority findings

### P1-1 — Production dependency advisories are open

Live `npm audit --omit=dev` results:

- Frontend: `fflate@0.8.2`, one moderate malformed-ZIP denial-of-service advisory (transitive through jsPDF/write-excel-file).
- Server: one high advisory group in `nodemailer@9.0.5`, moderate advisories in `morgan@1.11.0` and `qs@6.15.3`; five server advisories total.

The Nodemailer findings matter because recipient and message content are influenced by tenant data. Upgrade and add dependency audit/SBOM gates before launch.

### P1-2 — Access and refresh tokens are XSS-readable

Both tokens are stored in localStorage (`src/api/http.js:7-13`, `41-42`). Refresh rotation and reuse detection are good server controls, but an XSS or compromised frontend dependency can steal the long-lived refresh token and the browser-held book together.

Move refresh authentication to a Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie and keep the short access token in memory. Add a tested CSP at the public reverse proxy.

### P1-3 — Authorisation mutates permissions while handling a request

When an org creator lacks a requested permission, `requirePermission` creates the permission, grants it to Owner and proceeds (`server/src/middleware/rbac.ts:22-78`, `187-203`). New org bootstrap is deterministic, but this legacy fallback means a denied runtime request can alter security configuration and weakens audit predictability.

Backfill legacy owners once through a migration/admin job, then make request-time RBAC read-only.

### P1-4 — No stable server scheduler for recurring invoices

Schedules and catch-up execution live in React/localStorage and only run while a user opens the app. Browser clearing loses schedules; no signed-in user means no invoice generation; concurrent browsers can produce conflicting drafts.

Persist schedules server-side and materialise them with an idempotent job keyed by schedule and period.

### P1-5 — List APIs are mostly unpaginated

Audit logs are cursor-paginated, but invoices, payments, parties, items, ledger entries and several operational lists use unbounded `findMany` calls. This becomes a latency, memory and denial-of-service issue as real books grow.

### P1-6 — Data protection and retention operations are incomplete

The product stores names, contact data, PAN/GSTIN, bank and financial records, but the repository does not provide a complete consent/notice record, data-subject request workflow, deletion/export policy engine, breach-response runbook, or enforced retention/archival lifecycle. India notified the DPDP Rules in November 2025 with phased commencement; this now needs a dated legal implementation plan, not a generic roadmap note.

### P1-7 — Backup exists; recovery evidence does not

`deploy/backup.sh` takes consistent SQLite backups and keeps 30 archives. There is no automated encrypted off-host copy, restore script, periodic restore test, RPO/RTO target, or evidence that the backup has been restored successfully.

## Frontend and UX audit

### What is strong

- The public landing page is visually coherent, responsive-looking at the audited desktop size, clearly positioned and had no captured console warnings/errors.
- The design contract is unusually explicit: tokenised colour, two radii, money typography, shared screen/document rules and one primary action.
- Automated tests enforce raw-palette and field-padding constraints; the design-rule tests passed.
- Shared pickers, document keyboard hooks, list toolbar, print frame, notifications and document primitives show a credible path toward uniformity.
- Preview-only Billing, SSO and subdomain areas are clearly labelled as unconnected, avoiding deceptive demo states.

### What prevents uniformity

- `src/App.jsx` is 14,645 lines and mixes shell, routing, state, forms, reports and persistence. Visual consistency depends on discipline inside one unreviewable file.
- Navigation is state-based rather than URL/router-based. Most screens have no durable deep link, browser back semantics or route-level error/loading boundary.
- The documented migration is incomplete: 46 feature files use `PageHeader`, while significant screens still live in the root monolith; shared table/document primitives are not universal.
- Build output has two very large entry chunks: about 1.59 MB and 1.15 MB minified before gzip. The chart bundle is especially expensive for users who never open dashboards.
- Lint exits successfully but emits many React hook/compiler warnings, including missing dependencies and memoisation that React cannot preserve. These can create stale UI state in an accounting workflow even though they are not treated as errors.
- The authenticated application was not exercised in-browser in this audit because no test credentials were supplied and creating a tenant would mutate the user's local data. UI conclusions beyond the public/auth surface are source- and test-backed, not a complete manual click-through.

## Feature/business readiness

### Implemented and credible

Multi-company/branch/warehouse tenancy; users, roles and field-level access; sales and purchase document families; receipts/payments; double-entry ledger and trial balance; fiscal lock and hash chain; inventory transfers/adjustments plus batch/serial features; fixed assets; bank book and reconciliation; audit trail UI; imports/exports; e-invoice integration; GSTR-1/3B/2B utilities; multi-currency; SMTP settings; plan entitlements and module packs.

### Preview, partial or absent

- Billing/payment collection: preview/sample only; no subscription provider, invoices or tax handling.
- SSO and tenant subdomains: explicitly unconnected.
- Recurring invoices: client-triggered, not a service.
- GST filing: JSON/export assistance, not end-to-end filing; direct GSTN/GSP workflows and production certification need validation.
- Payroll/HRMS, budgets, automated bank feeds, payment links, customer/vendor portal, support/admin tooling, mobile/PWA conflict handling and production analytics are absent or not business-operational.
- No published pricing/terms, support SLA, onboarding/support console, incident ownership, status page, telemetry/alerting, or customer data export/closure process was found.

## Accounting and India compliance notes

The earlier HSN/B2CL finding is stale: `src/utils/gstrExport.js` now implements B2CL and Table 12 HSN aggregation. This is important because GST Portal guidance makes HSN summary reporting mandatory and separately requires B2B/B2C HSN details in current portal phases.

Remaining validation needed before marketing “GST filing ready”:

- schema-conformance tests against the current GST Offline Tool samples;
- Table 13/document-series handling and amendment/advance/nil/exempt cases;
- reverse-charge propagation through saved documents, reports and export;
- CA review of GSTR-1/3B totals and e-invoice/EWB edge cases;
- immutable change history for all financially relevant master/document changes, plus retention controls.

This is a product audit, not legal or tax advice; a qualified Indian CA and privacy counsel should sign off the production compliance matrix.

## Verification performed

- `git status`: clean `main`, equal to `origin/main`.
- `npm run lint`: exit 0 with warnings; React compiler deoptimised the oversized `App.jsx`.
- `npm run typecheck`: pass.
- Frontend Vitest: 37 files, 266 tests passed; repeated React `act(...)` warnings reduce signal quality.
- Backend Vitest: failed during global setup; zero server tests executed in this run.
- Frontend and API TypeScript builds: pass.
- Vite production build: pass with oversized-chunk warnings.
- Production dependency audits: 1 frontend moderate; 1 server high + 4 server moderate advisories.
- Browser: public landing page loaded at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`; captured console was clean.
- Secrets hygiene: real `.env` files and local databases are ignored; only Prisma schema is tracked from the inspected secret/database set.

## Recommended release sequence

1. Fix cross-account company discovery and add login plus `/auth/me` regression tests.
2. Make backend tests portable and green locally and in CI; fail lint on selected hook correctness rules.
3. Upgrade vulnerable production dependencies and add CSP/security-header tests.
4. Move recurring schedules and remaining financial writes to a single server system of record; add conflict/idempotency rules.
5. Introduce versioned Postgres migrations and a staging migration/rollback drill.
6. Add pagination to transaction/master APIs and split/lazy-load the root application.
7. Complete restore drills, encrypted off-host backup, monitoring, request IDs, error tracking and incident runbooks.
8. Obtain CA/privacy sign-off for GST export cases, audit retention and phased DPDP obligations.

**Go/no-go:** suitable for an internal demo or tightly controlled pilot using synthetic/non-critical books. **No-go for general paid production or sole-record accounting use today.**

## Competitor teardown — Zoho Books, TallyPrime and Vyapar

This comparison uses official public product and pricing pages checked on 10 September 2026. Competitor UI observations are product-level patterns inferred from their documented workflows and public screens; they are not authenticated usability tests of paid accounts.

### Strategic snapshot

| Product | Primary buyer | Core promise | Current pricing signal | Neev One lesson |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zoho Books | Cloud-first SMB and finance team | Connected accounting, automation and direct compliance | Free tier; Standard ₹749/org/month annually; Professional ₹1,499; Premium ₹2,999 | Benchmark for cloud workflow completeness and onboarding |
| TallyPrime | Accountant-led Indian business | Fast, familiar, locally controlled books | Silver ₹750/month or ₹22,500 lifetime; Gold ₹2,250/month or ₹67,500 lifetime | Benchmark for keyboard speed, offline ownership and accounting trust |
| Vyapar | Micro/small retailer and owner-operator | Simple billing, inventory and mobile/desktop utility | Desktop + mobile Silver ₹3,999/year; Gold ₹4,299/year on the checked India pricing page | Benchmark for fast first value, retail simplicity and price accessibility |
| Neev One | Best potential: CA firms and multi-branch Indian SMEs | One precise, modern workspace across companies, branches and users | Not commercially defined | Do not fight all three broadly; own multi-company control and calm professional UX |

### 1. Zoho Books teardown

**Where it wins**

- Complete cloud operating loop: direct GST filing, e-invoice/e-way bill, bank feeds, reconciliation, customer portal, online payments, recurring transactions, document storage and receipt scanning.
- Mature SaaS packaging: clear tiers, usage limits, paid user/location add-ons, support levels and a free acquisition tier.
- Automation depth: workflow rules, scheduled reports, reminders, approvals, recurring expenses and integrations across the Zoho suite.
- Trust through completeness: automatic cloud backup, mobile access, documented migration paths and a large help centre.

**UX pattern**

Zoho favours discoverability over density. Navigation and forms are conventional, labelled and approachable for a business owner. That lowers onboarding cost, but the large feature surface creates settings depth, plan-gated complexity and more visual chrome than a full-time accountant necessarily wants.

**Where Neev One can beat it**

- A genuinely better accountant/CA-firm cockpit across many companies. Zoho splits firm-level practice management from Books.
- Faster dense-data entry with stronger keyboard behavior and less dashboard decoration.
- Unlimited-user or branch-based packaging, if unit economics support it; Zoho charges per additional user and location.
- Self-hosted/private-cloud positioning for firms that do not want their client books in a general SaaS suite.

**What Neev One must copy before competing**

Direct compliance workflows, customer portal/payment collection, durable recurring jobs, connected banking, attachment/document storage, mobile access, complete onboarding/migration, dependable backups, and a real billing/support operation.

### 2. TallyPrime teardown

**Where it wins**

- Accounting muscle memory and speed: voucher-first workflows, extensive keyboard operation and dense reports suit trained accountants.
- Local/offline ownership: the product continues without an internet connection and offers perpetual licensing.
- Deep India-specific accounting, inventory, payroll, GST, e-invoice/e-way bill and Edit Log capability.
- Distribution and trust: a long-established ecosystem of accountants, partners, trainers and support resources.
- Connected banking is now a serious differentiator, including live balances/statements and smart reconciliation for supported banks.

**UX pattern**

Tally optimises for repetition and expert throughput, not immediate learnability. It is functionally dense and highly consistent once learned, but its terminology, drill-down model and keyboard conventions can feel opaque to a new owner or occasional user.

**Where Neev One can beat it**

- Modern browser access with a clearer visual hierarchy, richer contextual help and easier remote collaboration.
- Native multi-company team administration with explicit branch/warehouse boundaries and field-level permissions.
- Cleaner document creation for occasional users without sacrificing a keyboard path for accountants.
- API-first integrations and easier deployment than desktop/LAN/cloud-access combinations.

**What Neev One must copy before competing**

Near-zero-latency voucher entry, reliable keyboard-only operation across every form, offline/degraded-mode clarity, immutable edit-log completeness, payroll depth, backup/restore confidence, migration tooling and a partner/CA enablement program.

### 3. Vyapar teardown

**Where it wins**

- Extremely fast time to value for retailers: install, create a company, add an item and print/share a bill.
- Owner-friendly language and focused everyday jobs: billing, inventory, receivables, expenses and reports.
- Retail practicality: invoice templates, thermal printing, UPI QR, WhatsApp, barcode/POS, godowns, batch/expiry and stock alerts.
- Aggressive price/value signal and device-oriented plans that small businesses understand.
- Backup, restore-deleted-transaction and device sync are visible purchasing features rather than hidden infrastructure.

**UX pattern**

Vyapar optimises for obvious actions and touch-friendly workflows. It is less rigorous and less scalable as a finance-control system than Zoho or Tally, but it speaks directly to the owner who wants to make a bill now rather than configure an accounting platform.

**Where Neev One can beat it**

- Stronger ledger integrity, approvals, roles, audit trail, multi-currency and multi-company governance.
- A calmer, more premium desktop workspace for finance teams and growing businesses.
- Better separation of company, branch, warehouse and user authority.
- More credible path from daily operations to reviewed financial statements.

**What Neev One must copy before competing**

A shorter onboarding path, stronger mobile/POS experience, thermal-print and barcode polish, UPI/payment sharing, WhatsApp delivery, obvious backup/restore controls and pricing that a small owner can decide on without a sales call.

### Feature comparison

| Capability | Neev One | Zoho Books | TallyPrime | Vyapar |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Double-entry accounting | Strong core | Mature | Mature | Available, plan/product dependent |
| GST reports | Partial-to-strong exports | Direct filing and broad return coverage | Deep compliance | Broad reports |
| e-Invoice / e-Way bill | Integrated, production validation pending | Mature direct workflow | Mature | Available, plan limits apply |
| Bank reconciliation | Manual import and matching | Connected feeds + reconciliation | Connected banking + smart reconciliation | Basic/manual-oriented |
| Multi-company | Built | Per organisation; ecosystem support | Strong local company model | Plan-limited |
| Cross-company firm view | Early account overview; invitation defect | Separate broader practice ecosystem | Accountant workflow, not modern SaaS cockpit | Limited |
| Inventory/batch/serial | Broad | Stronger in higher plans | Deep | Strong retail focus |
| Roles/approvals | Strong architecture | Mature, plan-gated | Security controls | Simpler |
| Customer portal/payments | Missing | Mature | Sharing/connected services | Sharing and UPI-oriented |
| Recurring automation | Browser-triggered; unsafe for production | Mature server automation | Supported workflows | Available in product workflows |
| Payroll | Missing | Available through suite/plans | Built in | Not the core strength |
| Mobile | PWA shell only | Mature apps | Remote/cloud options rather than cloud-native mobile | Core differentiator |
| Offline resilience | Local shadow state, not a safe sync model | Cloud-first | Excellent | Strong desktop/mobile orientation |
| Audit/edit trail | Partial audit system | Mature controls | Strong Edit Log product | Restore/history features vary by plan |
| Commercial operations | Preview only | Complete | Complete | Complete |

### UI/UX comparison

| Dimension | Best benchmark | Neev One position | Required move |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-time discoverability | Vyapar / Zoho | Attractive landing and signup, but product depth appears quickly | Guided first invoice, imported opening data and checklist with real progress |
| Expert entry speed | TallyPrime | Good keyboard primitives, inconsistent coverage | Measure invoice/journal entry time and eliminate mouse-only breaks |
| Visual coherence | Neev One potential | Strong design contract; monolith makes compliance fragile | Finish PageShell/DataTable/EntryForm adoption and route-level extraction |
| Cross-device continuity | Zoho | Additive local/server hydration is not trustworthy sync | Server-only authority with explicit offline queue/conflict behavior |
| Mobile retail use | Vyapar | Not competitive | Purpose-built invoice/POS mobile surface, not merely responsive desktop |
| Multi-client oversight | Market opening | Architecture is promising; discovery bug blocks it | Fix foreign memberships, then make account overview the flagship workflow |
| Compliance confidence | Tally / Zoho | Capable engine, incomplete operational proof | CA-verified test pack, filing certification, immutable history and visible status |

### Recommended positioning

Do **not** position Neev One as “another GST accounting app.” That comparison makes it lose to Zoho on connected SaaS breadth, Tally on accountant trust/speed, and Vyapar on simplicity/price.

The defensible position is:

> **The multi-company finance workspace for Indian CA firms and growing branch businesses — modern to use, strict enough to trust, private enough to control.**

The product should make three workflows demonstrably better than competitors:

1. One accountant sees every assigned company, deadline, exception and receivable from one account.
2. A business owner grants precise company/branch/field access without buying and configuring another seat maze.
3. Every document moves from operational entry to ledger, approval, GST evidence and audit history without duplicate work.

### Competitive build order

1. Fix cross-account company discovery and make the account/firm overview the product's home.
2. Finish server authority, background recurring jobs and versioned Postgres migrations.
3. Add migration/import onboarding from Tally, Zoho and Vyapar with validation and reconciliation reports.
4. Complete direct GST filing/IMS workflows and obtain CA-verified compliance evidence.
5. Add connected banking, customer payment links/portal and WhatsApp document delivery.
6. Build accountant-speed keyboard benchmarks and a focused mobile invoice/POS companion.
7. Package simply: a low-risk pilot tier, a branch/team tier, and a CA-firm tier—avoid a six-plan feature maze at launch.
