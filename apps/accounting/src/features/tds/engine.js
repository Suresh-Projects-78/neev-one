 * So every screen asks this one function the same question and is handed the
 * same normalized answer, including the snapshot it must store.
 *
 * What the engine decides, in order:
 *
 *   1. Is TDS switched on for this company at all?
 *   2. Which nature applies — what the transaction says, else what the party
 *      says, else what the company says, else none.
 *   3. Which rule version was in force on the TRANSACTION's date.
 *   4. What the base is, and whether the threshold has been crossed.
 *   5. At what rate — the rule's, unless the party carries a certificate or
 *      has no PAN.
 *   6. Into which ledger it posts.
 *
 * It computes and explains. It does not write: posting stays with the code
 * that owns the document, and the compliance record is written from the result
 * this returns.
