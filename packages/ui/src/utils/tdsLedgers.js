 * The TDS ledgers a purchase can be deducted against.

 * On the buy side TDS is the buyer's own obligation: the vendor is paid short
 * and the difference is owed to the government until it is deposited. That
 * liability has to land in a real ledger, and which one is a decision the
 * company already made in its chart of accounts — a ledger under TDS Payable,
 * one per section it deducts under, each naming the section it accumulates.
 *
 * So the bill does not ask for a section out of a list of every section in the
 * Act. It asks which of *this company's* TDS ledgers the deduction belongs to,
 * and the section, and therefore the rate, follows from the ledger.
 *
 * Receivable TDS is a different animal — tax withheld from what the company is
 * owed, an asset — and is deliberately not offered here.
