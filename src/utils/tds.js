/**
 * TDS on a sales invoice.
 *
 * On the sell side TDS is not a tax the business charges — it is tax the
 * *customer* withholds from the payment and deposits against the seller's PAN.
 * So it never changes the invoice: the goods, the GST and the total are what
 * they were, and what moves is how much cash arrives. The document states the
 * deduction so both sides agree on the figure before the payment is short.
 *
 * That distinction matters in the ledger too. Reducing the invoice total by
 * the TDS would understate output GST and lose the receivable; the deduction
 * is a separate asset — tax already paid on the seller's behalf — that is
 * claimed against the year's liability.
 *
 * The base is the taxable value, not the total. CBDT Circular 23/2017: where
 * GST on services is shown separately on the invoice, tax is deducted on the
 * amount excluding that GST.

/**
 * The sections a sales invoice actually meets.
 *
 * Three things every entry carries, because leaving any of them out produced a
 * wrong number:
 *
 *   `rate` / `rateIndividual`
 *       194C is 1% where the payee is an individual or a HUF and 2% for
 *       everyone else, and the app charged 2% for all of them. 194J is not one
 *       rate at all: technical services, call centre and royalty are 2%, and
 *       professional services are 10%. Carrying a single "professional or
 *       technical @ 10%" entry meant every technical-services deduction was
 *       five times what was due.
 *
 *   `single` / `annual`
 *       The thresholds. Nothing is deducted below them, and the app had no
 *       notion of them at all — it would deduct 10% on a 5,000 rupee
 *       professional bill where nothing is owed until 50,000.
 *
 *   `wholeOnceCrossed`
 *       How the threshold behaves when it is crossed, which differs by section
 *       and is the part that is easy to get backwards. For 194C, 194J, 194H,
 *       194I and 194A the deduction applies to the WHOLE aggregate once the
 *       limit is passed, earlier payments included — five payments of 25,000
 *       cross the 1,00,000 annual limit and TDS is due on all 1,25,000. For
 *       194Q only the EXCESS over 50 lakh is charged.
 *
 * Rates remain defaults, not law for every case: a certificate under section
 * 197 overrides everything, and no PAN means 20%. The rate stays editable and
 * the section only seeds it.
 *
 * Codes are the familiar pre-2026 ones. From 1 April 2026 the Income-tax Act
 * 2025 consolidates TDS under section 393 and TCS under 394 — rates and
 * thresholds unchanged — so `newAct` carries the reference a FY 2026-27 return
 * needs alongside the code everyone still says out loud.
