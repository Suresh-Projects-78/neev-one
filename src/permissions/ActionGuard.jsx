/**
 * Telling somebody they cannot do a thing *before* they do it.
 *
 * The server enforces a hundred and nine permission checks across create,
 * edit, delete, export and approve. The interface checked none of them — it
 * only ever asked about VIEW, and only to decide what appears in the sidebar.
 *
 * So a user without SALES::Invoices::CREATE saw the New Invoice button, opened
 * the form, chose a customer, entered six lines, pressed Create, and was
 * refused. The work was real; the permission to keep it never existed.
 *
 * The rule this file settles, because it was never decided:
 *
 *   VIEW      → hide. A screen you cannot open should not be in the rail; the
 *               nav already does this.
 *   Everything else → show it, disable it, and say what is missing.
 *
 * Hiding an action teaches nothing. The user cannot tell a missing feature
 * from a withheld one, and their admin cannot be asked for something nobody
 * can name. A disabled button that reads "You need Sales · Invoices · Create"
 * turns a dead end into a sentence somebody can forward.
