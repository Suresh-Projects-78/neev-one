/**
 * Single sign-on, and deliberately not a sign-in button.
 *
 * The database has carried an `AuthProvider` table — OIDC and SAML fields, per
 * organisation, disabled by default — since the multi-tenant work, and nothing
 * has ever driven it. This page says that plainly and shows what setting it up
 * will ask for.
 *
 * What it must never do is show a working-looking "Sign in with…" button. Of
 * everything that can be mocked, an authentication control is the one that is
 * genuinely unsafe: a button that appears to sign someone in and does not is
 * security theatre, and the person who trusts it is trusting it about who can
 * reach their books.
 *
 * There is no form here either. A half-configured provider is worse than none,
 * and the fields are listed rather than offered so nobody fills them in and
 * believes it took.

              your provider to sign in; everybody else keeps using a password. Roles and company access stay here — the
              provider says who somebody is, not what they may do.
