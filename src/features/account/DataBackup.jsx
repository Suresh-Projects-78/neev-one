/**
 * Taking a copy of this company's books, and of how it is set up.
 *
 * Two backups, because they answer two different questions. Data is what the
 * business did — it is large, it only grows, and it is what you would hand an
 * accountant. Configuration is how the company is arranged: the chart of
 * accounts, numbering, roles, tax rates, the reference lists. It is small, it
 * changes rarely, and it is what you want when somebody has broken the invoice
 * numbering or when a practice is setting up its eleventh client the way it set
 * up the tenth.
 *
 * Deliberately not "system backup". The database backup is the operator's tool
 * — it is every customer's books in one file and no customer should ever hold
 * one. This is the other thing: one company's own data, for the people whose
 * data it is, in a file they can keep, read and take elsewhere.
 *
 * A customer who cannot get their data out is a customer who is locked in, and
 * the fastest way to lose trust is for that to be true.

          Reading a backup back in is not offered yet, and that is deliberate rather than forgotten. Restoring into a
          company that already has data has to decide what happens to every record that exists in both — and a restore
          that silently duplicates a year of invoices is worse than no restore at all. Until that is built, the file
          above is a record you can read, audit and hand to an accountant, not a one-click undo.
