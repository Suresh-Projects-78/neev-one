/**
 * The rendered proof, not just the helper's.
 *
 * A unit test on `formatDateIn` says the function is right; it does not say
 * the screen calls it. This one renders the real component and reads the day
 * off the page — 9 December has to arrive as `09/12/2026`, which is the
 * reading that a bare `toLocaleDateString()` got wrong on a US-locale machine.
 *
 * The expected day is derived rather than hard-coded: the screen shows the
 * LOCAL date, and no single instant is the same calendar day in every zone —
 * midday UTC on 9 December is already the 10th in Auckland. So the test pins
 * the two things that actually matter and hold everywhere: the shape is
 * `dd/mm/yyyy`, and it is not what the browser would have volunteered.
