/**
 * Whether a document has reached the books, asked before it is offered for editing.
 *
 * The server has refused to change the amounts on an issued invoice since
 * `d024b6d`: the document said 40,000 while the ledger said 118,000, and the
 * edit route was the one place in the product that could do that. The refusal
 * is right, but the form never knew about it — every financial control stayed
 * live, so the way to find out was to retype an invoice, press Save, and be
 * told by a toast that none of it could be kept.
 *
 * So the form asks first. `POSTED` is not the question — a reversal copies the
 * original's source document, so after a cancellation the only posted entry is
 * the contra that undid it. `getDocumentPostings` applies the server's own
 * definition (`postingState.ts`): posted, and not a contra one of this
 * document's own entries points at. The document's status is not the question
 * either: a Draft invoice posts today, so Draft does not mean "not in the
 * books" — the entries do.
 *
 * **It fails open, on purpose.** A caller without ledger permission gets a 403,
 * an offline browser gets nothing, and neither is evidence that the document is
 * unposted. Guessing "locked" there would take editing away from a draft over a
 * dropped request; guessing "open" leaves the form exactly as it was before this
 * existed, and the server still refuses. The cost of being wrong is a toast, and
 * only for somebody who could not have been shown the truth anyway.
