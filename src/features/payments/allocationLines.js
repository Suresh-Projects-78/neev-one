/**
 * One payment, several accounts.
 *
 * A bank payment of ₹10,500 to the GST department is not three payments. It is
 * one credit to the bank and three debits — tax, late fee, interest — and the
 * form that could only name a supplier and a bill forced it to be recorded as
 * three records that reconcile against one line on the statement, or as one
 * record with the fee buried in a "charges" box that posts nowhere useful.
 *
 * So the allocation is a list of ledgers and amounts, and the rule is the one
 * rule double entry has: the side that is one line and the side that is many
 * must come to the same figure. Bills and invoices already allocated on the
 * form count toward that total rather than sitting outside it — settling a
 * bill IS an allocation, to the party's own control account.
