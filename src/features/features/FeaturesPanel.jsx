/**
 * Features, opened over the screen you are on.
 *
 * This is Features as a TOOL, reached from ⌘K while you are in the middle of
 * something. Features as a DESTINATION is FeaturesPage on `#/features`, which
 * is what the rail goes to — the two are not the same thing and the shell
 * keeps them apart.
 *
 * Switching Sales Orders on from inside a half-typed invoice used to cost the
 * invoice: navigating remounted <main> on its new key and the form came back
 * empty. Reaching for the tool leaves the route alone, the screen underneath
 * stays mounted with every unsaved field intact, and closing it is the same
 * as never having opened it.
 *
 * A left-anchored panel, not a dialog and not a right drawer: it starts where
 * the content starts, directly after the rail, and covers about three
 * quarters of the content area — the rail stays visible so the product still
 * looks like the product, and the page underneath stays visible enough to
 * remember what you were doing. Geometry is measured from <main> rather than
 * assumed from rail widths, so a collapsed rail, a phone layout or a header
 * of a different height all just work.
 *
 * Not `aria-modal`, and that is the honest description. The scrim covers the
 * content area only; the rail and the header beside it stay lit AND operable,
 * and clicking a destination there puts this away and goes there. Claiming
 * modality would tell a screen-reader user that the rest of the page is not
 * there, while a sighted user can reach all of it.
 *
 * Layer: a drawer. Toasts and the command palette outrank it, so ⌘K over an
 * open panel still opens the palette on top.
