 * debit may be ₹8,000 of GST and ₹2,000 of interest; the parent never moves,
 * however the children are rearranged, because the bank's figure is the one
 * fact nobody in this building gets to edit.
 *
 * Stored in `db.bankAllocations`, one row per split line:
 *   { id, companyId, bankTransactionId, ledgerId, partyId?, partyKind?,
 *     amount, narration, journalEntryId?, createdAt }
 *
 * `journalEntryId` is the accounting linkage: it is set when a full
 * allocation posts, and it points at the one journal that carried the split
 * into the ledger — through the same engine every other entry uses.
