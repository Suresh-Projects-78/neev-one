/**
 * The TDS rule master: what the law says, and when it said it.
 *
 * The architecture the specification insists on is a separation the code did
 * not have. A ledger answers WHERE a deduction is posted. A rule answers WHY
 * it applies, at WHAT rate, above WHICH threshold and under WHICH statutory
 * reference. Until now the only tax data was a flat section list read at the
 * moment a form rendered, so "what rate did we deduct at in June" could only
 * be answered by whatever the list says today.
 *
 * Two things follow from that, and they are the whole of this file:
 *
 *   A nature is stable. CONTRACTOR is CONTRACTOR for ever, whatever the Act
 *   calls it this year, because every posted deduction, every report and every
 *   ledger mapping points at it.
 *
 *   A rule is versioned by effective date. Rates, thresholds and section
 *   references change; a posted transaction keeps the version it was computed
 *   under. Nothing here is ever edited in place.
 *
 * The rates and thresholds are not invented here: they come from the section
 * master the deduction engine already used, so there remains exactly one place
 * in the product where a rate is written down.
 */

/**
 * When the Income-tax Act, 2025 takes over.
 *

 * 194J(b). From 1 April 2026 the same deduction is made under the consolidated
 * section 393 reference, at unchanged rates and thresholds. Which of the two a
 * transaction carries is decided by the transaction's own date and never by
 * today's calendar: a bill dated last March, entered next week, is still a
 * bill under the old Act.

 * A nature code is a primary business identifier: every posted event, every
 * ledger mapping and every party default stores one, for ever. It used to be
 * derived from the section's display label — which meant renaming a label
 * silently reissued the identifier and orphaned everything that pointed at
 * the old one. That is exactly what "do not use visible names as primary
 * identifiers" forbids, one string-transform removed.
 *
 * So the codes are frozen here as literals, keyed by the statutory section
 * (itself stable). The values are today's derived spellings, kept verbatim —
 * "prettier" codes would orphan the very data the freeze protects. Rename a
 * label freely; the code does not move. A NEW section must be given a code
 * here deliberately (the fallback derivation below only keeps an unmapped
 * dev build rendering — the master test refuses to ship one).
