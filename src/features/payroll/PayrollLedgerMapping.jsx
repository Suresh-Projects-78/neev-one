/**
 * Where each part of a salary lands in the books.
 *
 * Payroll is usually the largest entry a company writes each month, and it
 * cannot be written at all until every component knows which account it posts
 * to. Companies discover this at the worst moment — the first time they press
 * Post, with payslips already produced — so this screen is built to be read as
 * a checklist rather than a form: what is still unmapped is the first thing on
 * it, and each row says plainly what it is waiting for.
 *
 * Which accounts a component may post to follows from what it is, and the
 * screen does not offer the wrong ones:
 *
 *   An earning is a cost. It needs an expense account and nothing else.
 *   A deduction is money withheld, and where it lands depends on why. Most is
 *     owed onward to somebody else — a fund, the tax department — which is a
 *     liability. But a loan recovery is the company taking back money it lent,
 *     which reduces an asset. So a deduction may post to either, and never to
 *     income.
 *   An employer contribution is a cost and a debt in one movement, so it needs
 *     both.
