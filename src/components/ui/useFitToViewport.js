/**
 * Make the scrolling part of a page end where the screen ends.
 *
 * Every list already scrolls its rows rather than the page, but the height it
 * was given was a guess — `100dvh - 21rem`, one number for screens that carry
 * five summary tiles, a filter band and a tab strip and for screens that carry
 * none of it. Too tall and the page scrolled as well as the rows, which is the
 * double scrollbar; too short and a third of the window sat empty under the
 * table.
 *
 * So it is measured instead: whatever the chrome above a scroller turns out to
 * be, the scroller gets the rest of the window minus the room its own card
 * needs underneath. Re-measured when the screen changes, when the window
 * resizes, and when anything above it grows — a filter band opening, a wrapped
 * toolbar, a company banner appearing.
 *
 * Not a substitute for a page that is honestly longer than a screen: a
 * dashboard of panels still scrolls, and should. This is for the one region on
 * a page that holds the rows.
