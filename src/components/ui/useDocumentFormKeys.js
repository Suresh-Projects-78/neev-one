/**
 * The keyboard behaviour every document form shares.
 *
 * Invoice, sales order, bill, purchase order, credit note, debit note,
 * receipt, payment and journal are the same shape of screen and, until this
 * existed, had nine different answers to "what does Enter do here" — which for
 * most of them was "submit the half-typed document".
 *
 *   Ctrl+S            save (the draft, where the caller offers one)
 *   Ctrl+Enter        commit
 *   Ctrl+;            today's date, in a date field (Excel's)
 *   Enter             move to the next field; inside the line grid, open the
 *                     next line
 *   ↑ ↓               move between fields; inside the grid, down a column
 *   ← →               move between fields, once the caret is at the edge
 *   Tab               from the last cell of the last line, open the next line;
 *                     out of a date field, straight to the next field
 *   Ctrl+= / Ctrl++   add a line
 *   Ctrl+D            duplicate the line the cursor is in
 *   Ctrl+Delete       delete it
 *
 * Ctrl+Delete rather than the bare Delete the review sheet asks for: Delete
 * belongs to the text cursor, and a quantity cell where Delete removes the
 * whole line instead of a digit is a cell nobody can type in.
 *
 * The grid callbacks are all optional — a payment has no lines, and passing
 * nothing simply leaves those keys alone.
 *
 * @param formRef        ref to the <form>
 * @param onSave         Ctrl+S. Defaults to submitting.
 * @param onCommit       Ctrl+Enter. Defaults to submitting.
 * @param lineCount      how many lines the grid holds
 * @param addLine        open a new line
 * @param duplicateLine  (index) => void
 * @param removeLine     (index) => void
 * @param autoFocus      selector for the field to land on when the form opens
 * @param isDirty        () => boolean, for the unload guard
