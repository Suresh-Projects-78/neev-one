 * menu still open on the page behind it does not, and a row-action menu that
 * paints over an open dialog is the bug this exists to prevent.
 *
 * The DOM cannot answer it: every overlay portals to `body`, so a popover's
 * ancestors say nothing about what opened it. React context can, because it
 * follows the render tree rather than the document.
