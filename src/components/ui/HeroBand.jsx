/**
 * The band every landing screen opens with.
 *
 * Home had it and the modules did not: Sales, Purchases and Inventory each
 * opened with a plain heading and a sentence, so moving from Home into a module
 * changed the shape and the ground colour of the top of the page for no reason
 * a reader could name. One component now, used by all of them — the title, the
 * one line under it, whatever governs the page on the right, and the ways in
 * along the bottom.
 *
 * What differs between screens is only what goes in it: Home greets you and
 * puts search on the right, a module names itself and puts its period picker
 * there. The shape, the spacing and the colour are not the caller's to choose.
