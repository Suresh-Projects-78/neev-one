/**
 * What a column *means*, rather than what it should look like.
 *
 * A list used to decide its own colours cell by cell, so the balance column in
 * Invoices and the balance column in Bills could disagree about what an unpaid
 * figure looks like, and the next list to be built would guess again. A column
 * declares its semantic type here and the appearance follows from that — which
 * is the only way the answer stays the same across invoices, quotations, sales
 * orders, purchases and receipts.
 *
 * Two rules hold throughout:
 *
 *   - Colour is never the only signal. A due date that is overdue is also
 *     heavier and carries a red glyph; a settled balance says "Settled" in
 *     words. Anyone who cannot separate the hues still gets the meaning.
 *   - Restraint. Cells are text on white. The tinted chip is spent on status,
 *     where the value *is* a category, and nowhere else.
