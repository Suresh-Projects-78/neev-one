/**
 * The shape of a document list page, in one place.
 *
 * Sales Invoices had it and its five siblings did not: a quotation list was a
 * bare heading, one primary button and a filter band, so moving between the two
 * screens meant learning the page again — search in a different place, export
 * behind a different control, no figures at the top and no status tabs at all.
 * The layout is the product's answer to "what is a list of documents", and it
 * cannot be the answer on one screen out of six.
 *
 * A shell rather than a whole page component: the columns, the row and what a
 * status means belong to the document, and forcing a challan through an invoice
 * template is how a list ends up with a Balance column that is always blank.
 * What is shared is where things sit and how they behave.
 *
 *   header  — title, description, search, page-level actions, one primary
 *   figures — the row of cards
 *   tabs    — status, with counts, as tinted pills
 *   table   — one card holding the whole grid
 *   tip     — one line under the table, dismissed for good
