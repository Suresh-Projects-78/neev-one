 * What actually differs between a customer and a vendor.
 *
 * Short on purpose. The two specs describe the same form twice and list the
 * differences at the end of the vendor one: the noun, which side of the ledger
 * an opening balance normally sits, sales price list against purchase, and a
 * TDS configuration that only a payee needs. Everything not in here is the same
 * for both by construction, rather than by two files having been kept in step.
