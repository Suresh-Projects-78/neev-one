 * One answer to "where do I turn a capability on?"
 *
 * There were four surfaces over one store: Settings → Preferences, six
 * Business panes filtered by subject, and the onboarding picker. Nothing was
 * ever out of step — they all wrote `setFeatures` — but nobody could say in
 * one sentence where to go.
 *
 * What this holds is the consolidation, because it is the kind that creeps
 * back: someone adds a "Sales settings" page with four switches on it and the
 * product has two answers again.
