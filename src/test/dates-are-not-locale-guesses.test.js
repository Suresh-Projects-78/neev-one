 * No accounting date is rendered by asking the browser what shape a date is.
 *
 * `toLocaleDateString()` with no locale hands the decision to whatever machine
 * the page opened on. Seven screens did that, and on a US-locale browser a
 * ledger dated 2026-12-09 read as the twelfth of September — the right number
 * and the wrong day, on a document someone files a return from.
 *
 * The product's format is `dd/mm/yyyy`, produced by `formatDateIn`. A call
 * that passes an explicit locale AND options is a deliberate choice (a chart's
 * month label, a datetime beside a login) and is left alone; a bare call is
 * not a choice at all.
