 * deploy renames every asset (the hash is the point), so each deploy left a
 * full set of dead files behind forever, and the only thing that ever emptied
 * it was the user clearing site data.
 *
 * A build is around 55 files, so this is roughly two builds' worth: enough that
 * an ordinary reload after a deploy is still served from the cache, and bounded
 * so the tail of old builds cannot accumulate. Eviction is oldest-first, which
 * the Cache API gives directly — `keys()` is in insertion order — and the cost
 * of evicting something still wanted is one network fetch, because nothing is
 * ever served from here that the network could not serve again.
