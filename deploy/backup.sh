#
# Two rewrites, for the same reason each time: this script described a
# deployment that did not exist. It first backed up a Docker volume on a box
# that runs systemd, and then three SQLite files on a box that now runs
# PostgreSQL — so on 25 Sep 2026 the nightly job was pointed at
# /opt/neev/data/prod.db, which had been migrated away an hour earlier. A
# backup script that names the wrong source does not fail loudly; it writes
# something, every night, that nobody looks at until the day it matters.

#   ./backup.sh                     # back up
#   ./backup.sh --verify            # back up, then prove the archive restores
#   ./backup.sh --restore FILE DB   # restore an archive into a NEW database

# ## Why this runs as the postgres superuser and nothing else will do
#
# Every tenant table has `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, which subjects the table's
# OWNER to its own policies — that is deliberate, and it is what makes the
# policies real rather than decorative. It also means pg_dump as the owner
# fails outright:
#
#   ERROR: query would be affected by row-level security policy for table ...
#
# PostgreSQL refuses rather than dumping a partial table, which is the right
# refusal and exactly the one you do not want discovered by a restore. A
# superuser is exempt from RLS entirely, so the dump is complete. The
# application role is subject to the policies with no company set and would
# quietly back up nothing at all, which is why it appears nowhere here.
