# One deployment at a time. On 18 Sep 2026 two machines deployed the same
# commit eight minutes apart — the second swept the first's hashed bundle
# while browsers still held a page pointing at it — and the forensics took
# longer than the deploys. So a deploy takes a lock ON THE SERVER first (the
# only place both machines can see), records who and what and when, and a
# second deploy refuses rather than overwriting. The lock is released on any
# exit, including failure and Ctrl-C; only a dead process leaves one behind,
# which is what --unlock is for. Every start and end is appended to
# /opt/neev/deploy.log so the next question of "what changed at 10:16?" has
# an answer.
#
# The frontend is built HERE, never on the server. The box has 954 MB of RAM
# and a Vite build peaks well above that; the build output is just static
# files, so it does not care which machine produced it. This is the whole
# reason a 1 GB instance is enough to run this app.
