/**
 * The statutory deductions: provident fund, ESI, professional tax, income tax.
 *
 * These are the amounts a company does not get to decide. They are set by law,
 * they change on dates somebody else picks, and getting one wrong is a penalty
 * rather than an apology. That shapes everything here.
 *
 * ## Rules are versioned, never edited
 *
 * A PF ceiling that moves in October must not change what April computed. So a
 * rule is a dated, versioned row, and a payslip records which version produced
 * each figure. Editing a live rate in place — the obvious design — would
 * silently restate every payslip that had used it, and there would be no way to
 * tell what the old answer had been.
 *
 * ## Nothing is hard-coded to one state or one year
 *
 * Professional tax is a different set of slabs in every state that levies it,
 * and the defaults below are seed data, not the engine. The engine reads slabs;
 * the slabs come from a rule. A company operating in two states deducts each
 * correctly because the employee carries the state, not the code.
 *
 * ## Every figure comes back with its reasoning
 *
 * Each result carries the wage it applied to, the rate, the ceiling if one
 * bound it, and the rule version — because "why is my PF 1,800 when I earn
 * 60,000?" has a real answer, and the answer is the ceiling.
