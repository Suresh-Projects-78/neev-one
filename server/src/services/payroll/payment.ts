/**
 * Paying people, and clearing what they were owed.
 *
 * Posting a payroll run records a debt: gross became an expense, and net became
 * money owed to four hundred people. This is the other half — the money leaving
 * the bank and the debt going away.
 *
 *   Dr  Salaries payable
 *       Cr  Bank
 *
 * ## Only what actually arrived
 *
 * A bank rejects lines. A wrong IFSC, a closed account, a name mismatch — three
 * people out of four hundred come back, and the entry has to say so. So a
 * payment posts the amount that was *paid*, never the amount that was
 * attempted: a failed line stays owed, stays visible, and gets paid in the next
 * batch. Posting the attempted total would clear a debt that still exists and
 * leave three people unpaid with nothing in the books to say it.
 *
 * ## The order of the two writes
 *
 * Payroll and accounting are separate databases, so a payment posts in two
 * steps and the order is chosen for what a crash between them leaves:
 *
 *   1. write the journal in accounting;
 *   2. record the journal's id on the payment.
 *
 * A crash after (1) leaves a journal with no receipt. The payment still reads
 * as unposted, and the next attempt finds that journal by its source document
 * and adopts it rather than writing a second one. The reverse order would leave
 * a payment claiming a journal that does not exist.
