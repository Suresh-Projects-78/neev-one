/**
 * A salary revision, and what it actually costs.
 *
 * An increment is usually agreed as one number — "twelve percent" — and then
 * discovered a month later to have meant something else. Twelve percent on CTC
 * is not twelve percent in the hand: PF rises with basic, the tax band may
 * change, and the employer's contribution rises too, so the company pays more
 * than the number anybody said. This module works out the real answer before
 * the revision is approved rather than after the payslip.
 *
 * The impact is a full calculation, not an estimate. The same engine that
 * produces payslips is run twice — once on what somebody is on now, once on
 * what is proposed — and the two are subtracted. An approximation here would be
 * wrong in exactly the cases that matter, because the interesting increments
 * are the ones that cross a threshold.
 *
 * What is shown at approval is stored with the revision. A year later, "we
 * approved this on the understanding it cost X" needs the X that was actually
 * on the screen, not one recomputed under today's rates.
