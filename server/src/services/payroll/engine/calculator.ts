/**
 * What a salary structure works out to.
 *
 * This is the core of payroll. The pay run will call it once per employee, and
 * the structure screen calls it on every keystroke to show what a structure
 * pays before anybody saves it. Everything it needs is passed in — it reads no
 * database, holds no state, and knows nothing about React or Express — so the
 * same inputs always produce the same numbers, which is what makes a payslip
 * defensible six months later.
 *
 * ## Resolution order is discovered, not declared
 *
 * Salary is written in terms of itself: HRA is a share of Basic, a special
 * allowance is whatever is left of CTC, and an employer's PF is a share of PF
 * wages which are a sum of other components. Asking whoever configures payroll
 * to also order the components correctly would be asking them to do the
 * computer's job, and would break the first time somebody inserted a line.
 *
 * So components are resolved in passes: anything whose inputs are known is
 * computed, which makes more inputs known, until nothing moves. What is left
 * unresolved after that is a genuine cycle — Basic as a share of Gross while
 * Gross counts Basic — and is reported as an error against the components
 * involved rather than silently becoming zero.
 *
 * GROSS is the interesting case. It is the sum of earnings that count towards
 * gross, so it cannot be known until those are, yet components legitimately
 * depend on it. It becomes available only once every non-GROSS-dependent
 * earning has settled, which is exactly the point at which it is true.
 *
 * ## Every number carries its reasoning
 *
 * Each line comes back with a trace: what it started from, the rule applied,
 * the proration, the rounding. That is not decoration — an employee asking why
 * their HRA changed is the most common question payroll receives, and the
 * answer has to come from the calculation rather than from somebody rebuilding
 * it by hand.
