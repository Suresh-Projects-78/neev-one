/**
 * A payroll run: turning a population and a period into payslips.
 *
 * ## Everything is read once
 *
 * A run of six hundred people that asks the database per person is six hundred
 * round trips before it has calculated anything. So every employee, assignment,
 * structure, component and adjustment the run touches is fetched in a handful
 * of queries and resolved in memory. The calculator itself is pure, so once the
 * data is loaded the arithmetic is CPU and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Validation runs before calculation, and separately
 *
 * A run stops at the first thing that would produce a wrong payslip, not the
 * first thing that throws. Someone with no salary assignment, a structure whose
 * dates do not cover the period, a negative net — these are reported against
 * the employee, all of them at once, so payroll is fixed in one pass rather
 * than discovered one error per attempt.
 *
 * ## What a payslip remembers
 *
 * Calculating writes a snapshot of everything that produced each figure: the
 * employee, the assignment, the structure and its components, the days, the
 * adjustments, and the engine version. A payslip reopened next year reads its
 * own snapshot, never today's configuration — so editing a structure tomorrow
 * cannot change what March paid. That is the property the whole module rests
 * on, and it is why calculation stores so much.
