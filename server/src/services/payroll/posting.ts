/**
 * Payroll into the books.
 *
 * Payroll keeps its own database, but there is only one set of books. A pay run
 * posts through the same ledger service sales and purchases use, so the journal
 * it produces is an ordinary entry that reports, the trial balance and an
 * auditor all see without knowing payroll exists. `PayrollPosting` is a receipt
 * recording which journal a run produced — it is not a second ledger.
 *
 * ## The entry
 *
 *   Dr  Salary expense              (every earning)
 *   Dr  Employer contribution expense
 *       Cr  Salary payable          (what people take home)
 *       Cr  PF / ESI / TDS payable  (what was withheld, owed to somebody else)
 *       Cr  Employer contribution payable
 *
 * It balances by construction: gross is net plus deductions, and every employer
 * contribution is an expense and a liability of the same amount. Where it does
 * not balance, something is misconfigured and the entry is refused rather than
 * plugged — a rounding account absorbing a payroll difference is how a payroll
 * error becomes invisible.
 *
 * ## Two databases, one write
 *
 * A transaction cannot span payroll and accounting, so posting is two steps and
 * the order is chosen for what a crash between them leaves behind:
 *
 *   1. write the journal in accounting;
 *   2. record the receipt in payroll.
 *
 * A crash after (1) leaves a journal with no receipt. The run still reads as
 * unposted, and the next attempt finds that journal by its source document and
 * adopts it instead of writing a second one. The reverse order would leave a
 * receipt for a journal that does not exist — a run that looks posted and is
 * not, which nothing downstream could detect.
