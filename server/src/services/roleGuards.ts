/**
 * The two rules that keep role administration from turning against the
 * organisation that configured it.
 *
 * 1. Nobody hands out more than they hold. A person allowed to edit roles
 *    could otherwise write every permission in the catalogue onto their own
 *    role, and a person allowed to edit users could hand themselves the
 *    Administrator role. Both were one request away. A grant is now bounded
 *    by the grantor's own effective set, and anything typed ADMIN — the role
 *    type that bypasses field levels — is administered only by an
 *    administrator.
 *
 * 2. The organisation always keeps an administrator. Removing, deactivating
 *    or demoting the last active user who holds an org-wide ADMIN role, or
 *    stripping that role of the permissions needed to administer roles and
 *    users, is refused. The creator's role is repaired on the next load of
 *    /permissions/me, but a creator who has been removed from the company
 *    never loads it.
