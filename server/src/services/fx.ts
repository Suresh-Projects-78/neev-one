/**
 * Foreign currency — requirement 8.
 *
 * The governing rule: **the general ledger is kept in one currency**, the org's
 * base currency. A document may be raised in any currency, but what reaches the
 * books is that document translated at a stored rate. Posting mixed currencies
 * into one ledger would make the trial balance a sum of unlike things — it
 * would still foot to zero and still be meaningless.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because they are what makes this correct
 * rather than merely present:
 *
 *  - Rates are dated and looked up as of the document date, never "latest".
 *    Restating a closed period at today's rate changes reported results after
 *    the fact.
 *  - Settling a foreign receivable at a different rate produces a real gain or
 *    loss. It is posted to its own account rather than quietly adjusting
 *    revenue, which would misstate both.
