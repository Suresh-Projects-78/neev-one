/**
 * Gives this run its own database, with a schema per application inside it.
 *
 * The suite used to own three SQLite files, which is why it stopped working
 * the day the product moved to PostgreSQL: `prisma db push` against
 * `file:./test.db` cannot apply a `postgresql` schema, and the whole suite
 * died in setup before a single test ran.
 *
 * So the databases are created here and dropped at the end. Named for the
 * process id, because two runs at once must not reset each other — that was
 * the original reason for per-run files and it has not changed.
 *
 * Creating a database needs a connection to a database that already exists, so
 * the run borrows `postgres` for the two statements it needs. Prisma is used
 * for it rather than `psql`, so the suite depends on nothing but the driver it
 * already has.

 * initialisation error rather than as a missing setting.
