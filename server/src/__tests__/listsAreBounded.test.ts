/*
 * A read of something that grows with trading has to have a ceiling.
 *
 * An unbounded `findMany` is fine on the books it was written against and a
 * problem on real ones: the response grows with the customer's business, so the
 * slowest and heaviest request is the one their best month produces. It is also
 * the cheapest denial of service in any product — one GET, and the server
 * builds an arbitrarily large response.
 *
 * Scoped deliberately to the models that grow. A first version of this test
 * demanded a ceiling on every `findMany` in the routes and flagged sixty,
 * nearly all of them reference reads — the roles in an org, the branches on an
 * account, the permission catalogue. A rule that fires on that much is one
 * people learn to wave through, and a waved-through rule protects nothing.
 *
 * These are the tables whose row count is set by how much business the customer
 * does, rather than by how they configured the product.
