/**
 * One person, one login, access anywhere they are invited.
 *
 * A user used to be reachable only inside the account they signed up under.
 * Membership was matched on the account carried in the token, so a membership
 * in anybody else's organisation was unmatchable by construction — it could be
 * written and would never work — and adding somebody who already had a login
 * elsewhere was answered with 409.
 *
 * That is wrong for a general product, not only for the accountant example it
 * was first noticed with. A person joining a second business, an auditor given
 * sight of a group company, a consultant working across two clients: all of
 * them are one person who should not need a second identity with the same
 * address.
 *
 * The account now comes from the MEMBERSHIP that authorised the request, not
 * from the token. For somebody working in their own company the two are the
 * same value, which is why this changed nothing for anyone who already existed.
