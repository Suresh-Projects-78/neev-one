/**
 * The public handle for a company — the `agc` in agc.books.neevone.com.
 *
 * Two identifiers on purpose. The cuid `id` carries every foreign key and every
 * authorisation check and never changes; the slug is what a person reads in a
 * URL and quotes to support, and is the one that will eventually have to change
 * for somebody. Conflating them is how renaming a company breaks its own
 * foreign keys.
 *
 * The original idea was the first three letters of the name. That collides
 * immediately — AGC Traders and AGC Exports both give `agc`, and so does
 * Agarwal Consultants — which in a product aimed at Indian SMEs, where a family
 * of firms shares a prefix by design, is the first week rather than an edge
 * case.
