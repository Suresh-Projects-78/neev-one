/**
 * Plans: what a customer is ALLOWED to have.
 *
 * This is the layer above the feature catalogue, and the two answer different
 * questions. A feature setting is a preference — the customer turned warehouses
 * off because they have one shop. A plan is a commercial ceiling — the customer
 * may not turn manufacturing on because they did not buy it.
 *
 * Merging the two is the mistake this file exists to avoid. With one layer,
 * every plan needs its own copy of every switch, and cancelling a subscription
 * means somebody turning forty settings off by hand. With two, the plan changes
 * and the ceiling moves; the customer's own preferences underneath it are
 * untouched and come back if they upgrade again.
 *
 * Plans are defined here rather than in the database on purpose. A plan is a
 * product decision that ships with the code and wants to be reviewable in a
 * diff; only *which plan an account is on* is data.
 *
 * `features: '*'` entitles everything. FULL is the default for an account with
 * no entitlement row, which is every account that exists today — so introducing
 * this layer changes nothing until a plan is deliberately assigned.
