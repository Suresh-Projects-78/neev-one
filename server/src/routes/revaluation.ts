/**
 * Period-end revaluation of open foreign balances — requirement 8.
 *
 * A receivable in USD was brought into the books at the rate on its invoice
 * date. If the rate has moved by the reporting date, the balance sheet still
 * shows the old number, which overstates or understates the asset. Revaluation
 * restates what is still open and books the difference as an unrealised gain
 * or loss.
 *
 * Unrealised, deliberately: nothing has been collected. The realised gain or
 * loss is posted separately when the invoice is actually settled (see
 * routes/payments.ts), so this entry is normally reversed at the start of the
 * next period to avoid counting the same movement twice.
