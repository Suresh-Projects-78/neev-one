/**
 * A company's own books and its own settings, in files its owner can keep.
 *
 * Two scopes, because they are two different things with two different uses.
 *
 * **Data** is what the business did: parties, documents, payments, the ledger.
 * It is large, it only grows, and restoring it into a company that already has
 * some is genuinely hard.
 *
 * **Configuration** is how the company is set up: branches, the chart of
 * accounts, numbering series, roles and permissions, tax rates, approval rules,
 * the reference lists. It is small, it changes rarely, and it is the thing you
 * want when somebody has broken the invoice numbering, or when a practice is
 * setting up its eleventh client company the way it set up the tenth.
 *
 * Asking for both in one file would mean a config restore had to carry a year
 * of invoices with it, which is why they are separate.
 *
 * Not the same thing as the server backup, and the difference matters. The
 * SQLite backup is an operator's tool: it is the whole multi-tenant database,
 * every customer's books in one file, and no customer should ever be handed
 * one. This is the other thing — one company's own data, for the people whose
 * data it is.
 *
 * Which is also why it is worth having beyond convenience: a customer who
 * cannot get their books out is a customer who is locked in, and under the DPDP
 * Act a data principal is entitled to their data in a portable form.
 *
 * bounded-file: every read here is deliberately unbounded.
 *
 * This is the company's own copy of its own books, so a page of it would be the
 * wrong answer rather than a partial one — a backup missing the invoices after
 * row 500 is not a backup. The limit that matters here is not a row count, it
 * is the org filter on every query below.
 *
 * Scoped to the active org throughout. The one defect that would matter here is
 * one company's export containing another's, so every query is filtered by
 * account and org, and a test asserts a second company's rows never appear.
