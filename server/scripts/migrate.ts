/**
 * Applies outstanding migrations to every schema, as the owner.
 *
 * Two things this has to get right, and both are about who is connected.
 *
 * **The role.** The application connects as `clor_app`, which owns nothing and
 * cannot bypass row-level security — that is the whole point of it. A role
 * that cannot bypass RLS also cannot conveniently alter the tables it is being
 * kept out of, so migrations run as the owner instead, built here from
 * PGADMIN_URL. Running them as the application role fails halfway through with
 * a permission error, which is a worse way to learn this than a sentence.
 *
 * **The schema.** One database, one schema per application. Prisma is told
 * which schema through the connection URL, so "apply the payroll migrations"
 * means running with an owner URL that carries `?schema=payroll` — not with
 * whatever `PAYROLL_DATABASE_URL` happens to say, which is the application's
 * credentials.
 *
 * Safe on a brand-new database and on one already migrated: `migrate deploy`
 * applies what is missing and says so when there is nothing to do. Run after
 * this, not before: scripts/provisionAppRole.mjs, which grants the application
 * role access to whatever the migrations have just created.
