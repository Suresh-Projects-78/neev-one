/**
 * Puts the generated Prisma clients where the compiled code looks for them.
 *
 * Accounting's client is a package — `@prisma/client` — and needs nothing.
 * Payroll's and People's are not: each schema generates into
 * `src/generated/<app>`, because two clients cannot share one package name,
 * and `src/utils/payrollPrisma.ts` imports `../generated/payroll/index.js`.
 *
 * That import compiles to `dist/utils/payrollPrisma.js` reaching for
 * `dist/generated/payroll/index.js` — and tsc does not put it there. tsc
 * compiles TypeScript; the generated client is JavaScript that was never
 * TypeScript, so it is not in `include`, not emitted, and not copied. The
 * build therefore succeeded, the tests passed (they run the TypeScript
 * directly through tsx) and the API died on its first import in production:
 *
 *   ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND  file:///opt/neev/server/dist/generated/payroll/index.js
 *
 * A build that cannot start is a build that did not finish, so finishing it
 * is part of `npm run build` rather than a step in the deploy — the deploy is
 * not the only thing that builds.
