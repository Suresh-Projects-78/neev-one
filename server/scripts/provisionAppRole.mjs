/**
 * The role the application connects as.
 *
 * Row-level security is not enforced against a superuser. Not "usually not" —
 * never: PostgreSQL skips policies entirely for a superuser or a role with
 * BYPASSRLS, whatever the table says, FORCE or not. A local install typically
 * makes your own account a superuser, so a development database can carry a
 * full set of policies, pass a hand-written check, and be protecting nothing.
 * That is precisely what happened here: the policies were applied, and a query
 * with a deliberately wrong company still returned every row.
 *
 * So the application gets its own role, which owns nothing and bypasses
 * nothing. Migrations keep running as the owner, because a role that cannot
 * bypass RLS also cannot conveniently alter the tables it is being kept out
 * of.
 *
 *   node scripts/provisionAppRole.mjs
 *
 * Idempotent: run it after a migration that adds tables, or whenever the
 * grants look wrong. Reads PGADMIN_URL (the owner) and CLOR_APP_PASSWORD.
